# HONEYPOT

### Introduction

*What is honeypot ? Honeypots are decoy servers that are used to gather information about attackers or users who access information systems without authorization. A honeypot can often be a computer that appears to be part of a network, or any server hosting data. In fact, it is an isolated and specially monitored resource that, to attackers, looks like a target of information or value that could cause them to attack.*

*In answer to the question of why it is called a honeypot, if we compare the attacker to someone who loves honey, as soon as he sees the honeypot - and if there is a feeling of hunger - he will want to put his hand inside. Because when viewed from the outside, you will have the impression that there is honey in it, so when you put your hand into the honeypot, it will be stung by the bees.*
